A popular conversation brought up on the Developer Forum is regarding the modification of the Lua Chat System. Furthermore, within that topic, developers often find themselves wanting to change the chat style between Classic, Bubble and Both. This is due to an update that removed that option from the game settings page in hopes of a better way to configure chat properties in the future.

A common solution I've seen being provided to developers is to fork the chat system's contents and modify the booleans ClassicChatEnabled and BubbleChatEnabled in the ChatSettings module. I don't like this solution for two reasons.

1. You should not be forking the ***entire*** Lua Chat System just to modify two settings. It is possible to change chat types by only forking the ClientChatModules folder and only including ChatSettings in it. This forks that module alone and the rest are inserted as necessary.

2. You should not be forking systems for minor edits. Forking prevents updates to a system and thus you are held responsible for manually updating anything changed. If you don't fork, you get the code inserted directly from the latest CoreScripts branch, which means automatic updates.

With this in mind, I'd like to share with you [Chat.RegisterChatCallback](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Chat/RegisterChatCallback). While there is documentation that briefly explains what you can do with the function and what it's used for, I often feel that it's not explained fully. For this thread, I will be explicitly explaining the option OnCreatingChatWindow. A code examples thread for RegisterChatCallback as a whole is for another time.

Let's grab the documentation for RegisterChatCallback and the OnCreatingChatWindow section.

> RegisterChatCallback binds a function to some chat system event in order to affect the behavior of the Lua chat system. The first argument determines the event (using the  `ChatCallbackType`  enum) to which the second argument, the function, shall be bound. The default Lua chat system uses  `InvokeChatCallback`  to invoke registered functions. Attempting to register a server- or client- only callback on a peer that isnâ€™t a server or client respectively will raise an error. The following sections describe in what ways registered functions will be used.

> **OnCreatingChatWindow**
> 
> Client-only. Invoked before the client constructs the chat window. Must return a table of settings to be merged into the information returned by the ChatSettings module.

The documentation is self explanatory and sufficient here. RegisterChatCallback binds a function to a specific ChatCallbackType and the chat system used InvokeChatCallback to run your functions when specific conditions are met. The condition is typically the ChatCallbackType Enum which summarises very well what something is. I shouldn't have to explain what OnCreatingChatWindow means.

Now, the thing about OnCreatingChatWindow is that it is able to modify the ChatSettings. How can we use this to our advantage and change the chat type? We simply bind a function that returns a table of settings to be modified.

Let's change our game's chat type to Bubble Chat for our example. In a LocalScript preferably under ReplicatedFirst, set this up:

```lua
local Chat = game:GetService("Chat")

Chat:RegisterChatCallback(Enum.ChatCallbackType.OnCreatingChatWindow, function()
    return {
        ClassicChatEnabled = false,
        BubbleChatEnabled = true,
    }
end)
```

Keep in mind that OnCreatingChatWindow can only be used on the client. Don't write it in a server script, that'll produce an error.

And that's it. All you need to know. Have fun. All that text just to lead up to this one small piece of code and not even a satisfactory conclusion. Wow!

Before you go though, there is one last thing that may be of interest to you; remember that I said this has the capability to modify the chat settings. This means that you can return any number of key-value pairs to edit the chat system with.

Here is a full list of the possible settings keys you can include in your settings return table. This is mainly if you're looking for a reference or you haven't forked the chat system before and taken a scroll through the contents of ChatSettings.

I've taken the liberty to not waste time and explain self-explanatory labels, for the most part.
